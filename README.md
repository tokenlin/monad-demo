# Workshop Plan for Tug of War Game on Monad Blockchain

Monad is a layer 1 blockchain with 10,000 transactions per second, 1-second block times, single-slot finality, and low-hardware requirements.

And this workshop will introduce how to build a simple dapp on the Monad chain. We use Scaffold-ETH2-Open source toolkit which has built-in wagmi and viem libraries and Foundry, to build dapp.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Scaffold-ETH2 toolkit: Type folder name you want, and choose Foundry
  ```
  npx create-eth@latest
  ```


## Start

Enter the file directory you just created, and there are two important folders under the packages folder, one is Foundery which manages our solidity contracts including compile, deploy, and test.

And we need to open 3 separate terminals.

1. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```
This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

2. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

3. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```
Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.






## Foundry-Local Test
1. Edit solidity contract: We use "Tug of War Game" demo.
Copy the content of file `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/foundry/contracts/YourContract.sol`, and repleat the content of local file `packages/foundry/contracts/YourContract.sol`.
2. Modify the test script: Copy the content of file `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/foundry/test/YourContract.t.sol`, and repleat the content of local file `packages/foundry/test/YourContract.t.sol`.
3. Use `yarn test` command on the second terminal to test the solidity contract edited by us.
4. Use `yarn deploy` command again on the second terminal to deploy the contract to the local network. 




## Foundry-Deploy to Chain
1. Set `.env`

    The `packages/foundry/.env` file is automatically generated by the toolkit. 
    
    Copy the file content `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/foundry/.env.example`, and repleat the content of local file `packages/foundry/.env`.
 
    We need to add private key prefixed with of "0x" to `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, and RPC to `MONAD_RPC`.


2. Set `monad` Chain

    Add `monad` chain in line 10 of `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`: 
    ```
    ...
    [rpc_endpoints]
    default_network = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
    localhost = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
    monad = "${MONAD_RPC}"  # add monad chain
    mainnet = "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}"
    ...
    ```

3. Deploy to Chain
- `sepolia`: Make sure the address of your privatekey has enough ETH to pay gas.
  ```
  yarn deploy --network sepolia
  ```
- `monad`: Make sure the address of your privatekey has enough MON to pay gas.
  ```
  yarn deploy --network monad
  ```

4. Verify Contract: 
- `sepolia`: 
    ```
    yarn verify --network sepolia
    ```
- `monad`: TBD






## NextJS

1. Modify UI
- Page: 

    Copy the file content `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`, and repleat the content of local file `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`.

- Styles:

    Copy the file content `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/nextjs/styles/globals.css`, and repleat the content of local file `packages/nextjs/styles/globals.css`.

  Then, you can view the complete UI on your `http://localhost:3000`. Currently it is base on the contract deployed on local testnet.

  In order to test on the local test network, firstly need to get local native token to pay gas, just click the right-top buttom to grab funds from faucet.




2. Connect to Chain-`sepolia`

    Since `sepolia` is built into toolkit, there is no any modification.


3. Connect to Chain-`monad`
- Set `.env`

  Copy the `packages/nextjs/.env.example` and paste it in same folder, then modify it to `.env`.

  Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPCURL_MONAD` key in `.env`, just copy the file content `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/nextjs/.env.example`, and repleat the content of local file `packages/nextjs/.env`.

  Add RPC to `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPCURL_MONAD` key in `packages/nextjs/.env`.

- Add `route.ts`

  Create new path `/api/proxy/` under the `packages/nextjs/app/`, the full path is `packages/nextjs/app/api/proxy/`

  Create new file `route.ts`, and copy the file content `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/nextjs/app/api/proxy/route.ts`, and paste it into the new file `route.ts`.

- Add `networks.monad.ts`

  Create new file `networks.monad.ts` under the folder `packages/nextjs/utils`. 
  
  Copy the file content `https://github.com/tokenlin/monad-demo/blob/main/packages/nextjs/utils/networks.monad.ts`, and paste it into the new file `networks.monad.ts`.

- Modify Setting

  Currently, only local testnet can be connected. In order to connect the block chains of `sepolia` or `monad`, we need to modify the setting in the file `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

  Import monad network, comment out line 5, and add a new line below to add `sepolia` and `monad` network in the file `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`. This will switch to the `sepolia` and `monad` network.
  ```
  import * as chains from "viem/chains";
  import { monad } from "./utils/networks.monad";  // import monad network

  ...
  const scaffoldConfig = {
  // The networks on which your DApp is live
  // targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],  // comment out
  targetNetworks: [monad, chains.sepolia],  // add new networks
  ...
  ```







## Metamask Wallet
1. `sepolia`: just turn on the `Show test networks` buttom, then will show the `sepolia` testnet.

2. `monad`: Open `Setting` on Metamask Wallet, choose `Networks`, and click `Add a network`, enter the following infos:
    ```
    Network name: Monad
    New RPC URL: https://xxx(enter the monad RPC)
    Chain ID: 41454
    Currency symbol: MON
    Block explorer URL(Optional): https://xxx(enter the monad explorer URL)
    ```


## Enjoy Demo

Now that we have everything set up, we can happily interact with on-chain contracts in our local UI using the `monad` testnet.
